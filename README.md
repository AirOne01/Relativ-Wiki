# Relativ copy

The old Relativ (Relativty) wiki, crawled and copied as PDFs for documentation.
I needed to copy that because unfortunately they deleted the wiki in favor of the new version of Relativty, except I bought the parts for the old version and I needed that documentaion, so I headed to the Wayback Machine and copied every pages there as PDF.

Head to the "pages" folder to start. The Homepage file is located at "pages/The Relativ Wiki.pdf".
